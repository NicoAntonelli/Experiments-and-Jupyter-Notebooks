## Ackermann Function: Larger than the Universe
The Ackermann function is a recursive function in Computability Theory. But a human has never seen on screen the result of applying the function to high initial values, even fairly small base numbers like A(4, 2)... and there is a reason for that.

## CT Decipher Challenge
A little game of decoding an encrypted message. Challenge requested by an Argentinian company called "CompuTrabajo". It seems a little hard... but challenge accepted!

## Cantor Set: Fractal
Excercise extracted from my Genetic Algorithm's classes at UTN in 2019. I will improve it a bit in the future and rewrite it on a jupyter notebook. The Cantor Set is one of the most famous fractals.

## Statistical Frecuency Functions
I don't know. They're just some functions that I use once, because Numpy doesn't accept a "Frecuency Population" parameter for the calculation of mean, variance and standard deviation.

## Canvas
UNDER CONSTRUCTION... in the future it will contain something related to basics Deep Neural Networks.

## TypeScript & SASS Mini-Course
Just a folder with that mini-course. I didn't know where to put it.
